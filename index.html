    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      Many factors contribute to the difficulty of choosing a recipe to cook, such as the overwhelming variety of ingredients that are used, the nutritional value of the meal, and the number of steps that it takes to make the meal. Visualizing the different recipes that are available to users by first filtering by specific ingredients and next ordering them by health and simplicity allows them to quickly scan which recipes are the most relevant to them, resulting in an optimal cooking experience.</strong>

    The visualization above primarily uses a scatterplot as well as a word cloud. Users are able to pick 2 different measures out of number of minutes, protein, calories, total fats, sodium, saturated fat, carbohydrates, and number of steps to create the scatterplot. The scatterplot shows the data color-coded by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, drinks, snacks) and the frame of the plot is constrained to show a certain maximum number of data so that users are not overwhelmed. Upon hovering over data points, a card for the recipe will appear, showing its name and information about it. Within the scatterplot, users also have the ability to brush over areas of points, creating a compiled list of all the recipes in that brushed region. This visualization also contains a word cloud to help users discover recipes based on specific ingredients. Users can select ingredients in the word cloud, which will filter the recipes on the scatterplot so only recipes that contain the selected ingredients will be shown. Users also have the ability to save recipes in a table by clicking on the recipe's corresponding data point. This allows the recipe to be saved and for the user to see all the information about it. Through the scatterplot as well as the word cloud, the user is able to make recipe finding more easy and efficient.
