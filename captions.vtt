00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
hi, this is the demo video for

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
visualizing the recipe, which is based off

00:00:04.143 --> 00:00:05.550
the Food.com Kaggle dataset.

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:08.144
Our visualization is composed of

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:09.485
a scatterplot and a word cloud 

00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:11.549
and by using the dropdowns

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.022
on the x and y axes

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.370
a user is able to select attributes that 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.107
they may want to compare about a recipe.

00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:20.741
So lets say they wanted to compare protein to calories.

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:26.962
By selecting these attributes on the x and y axes,

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:28.713
the graph itself also updates

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:31.119
accordingly to reflect these attributes.

00:00:31.743 --> 00:00:33.743
We can then hover over a point to show

00:00:33.743 --> 00:00:34.951
the individual recipe

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:37.163
or we can use a brushing mechanism

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.535
to get a list of all the recipes within a brush

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:40.985
and even

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.800
look at the specifics

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:45.586
of the selected attributes

00:00:46.142 --> 00:00:48.817
and then we can click on the actual name itself

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.532
to get to the associated Food.com website.

00:00:51.826 --> 00:00:53.673
We also have a legend that shows whether the points

00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:55.982
are breakfast, lunch, or dinner items.

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:58.048
 The word cloud on the right is composed of

00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:00.770
the most common ingredients in all the displayed recipes

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.948
and therefore are the ingredients that a user is

00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:04.948
most likely to have in their fridge (or on hand)

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:08.725
If i wanted to find a recipe that has just egg and onions,

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:12.335
I would click on egg, then I would click on onion

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:14.843
and now on the scatterplot are displayed

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:17.323
only recipes with egg and onion.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.058
And I can use the button down here to clear all ingredients.

00:01:21.558 --> 00:01:22.777
And reset it back to zero. 

00:01:23.627 --> 00:01:26.460
But let's say I wanted to look and save the recipes

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.883
that have eggs and onions.

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:31.189
I could go onto the scatterplot and click

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.925
on the point and the recipe itself is then

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:36.766
is then added to the table down here.

00:01:38.073 --> 00:01:39.922
And I could keep adding these recipes

00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:41.584
until I don't want to anymore.

00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:44.301
Let's say I just added a breakfast item

00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:45.481
and two dinner items,

00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:48.524
and we can compare the individual attributes

00:01:48.982 --> 00:01:51.497
and once we're done we can clear all the saved recipes.

00:01:51.955 --> 00:01:53.946
And what's cool is we can also even go

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:56.969
to the Food.com website by clicking on the name itself.
